# Public Assets

## Logo

Place your company logo here as `logo.png`. The logo will be used across:
- Website navbar
- Admin portal
- Receipts

**Recommended specifications:**
- Format: PNG (with transparency) or SVG
- Size: 200x200px or larger
- Square format works best
- File name: `logo.png`

The logo will automatically be used throughout the application once you place it in this directory.

## Placeholder Images

The application includes SVG placeholders for properties and plots when no images are available:
- `placeholder-property.svg` - Used for properties without images
- `placeholder-plot.svg` - Used for plots without images

These can be customized or replaced as needed.
